# Contributing to Quantum_Forge

Welcome! This project is organized for a two-developer team .
Please follow these guidelines to keep the repository healthy.

- Branches: Use feature branches (`feature/<short-desc>`) and open PRs to `main`.
- Commit messages: Use present-tense short messages, e.g. "Add xTB runner tests".
- Tests: Add unit tests for new behavior and run `pytest` before pushing.
- Docs: Keep docs in `/docs`. Add or update glossary/setup/API docs when behavior changes.
- Security: Never commit secrets. Use `.env` and `.env.example` for config templates.

If you're the junior developer, open a draft PR early and request review.
