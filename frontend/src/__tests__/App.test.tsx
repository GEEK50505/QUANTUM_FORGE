/**
 * App Component Tests (Example)
 * 
 * Example tests to demonstrate the test structure for the App component.
 * 
 * For non-coders: This file shows how automated tests would check if the main
 * application component loads properly. Tests help ensure the application
 * continues to work as expected when changes are made.

// Example test structure - in a real implementation, you would use:
// import React from 'react';
// import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react';
// import App from '../App';

/**
 * Example test case:
 * 
 * test('renders without crashing', () => {
 *   render(<App />);
 *   expect(screen.getByTestId('app-layout')).toBeInTheDocument();
 * });
 * 
 * This test would:
 * 1. Render the App component
 * 2. Check that the app layout is present in the document
 * 3. Pass if the element is found, fail if not
