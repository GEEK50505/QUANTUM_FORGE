# Frontend Application - Under Active Development

## 🖥️ Overview

This directory contains the React-based web frontend for the Quantum Forge platform, providing an intuitive user interface for hybrid quantum-classical simulations.

**Status: Under Active Development** - This is a pre-beta development area. Features and APIs are subject to change.

## 🎯 Purpose

The frontend application provides a user-friendly interface for:

- **Simulation Management**: Create, configure, and monitor simulations
- **Visualization**: Interactive plots and 3D visualizations of results
- **Data Exploration**: Browse and analyze simulation datasets
- **Collaboration**: Share results and collaborate with team members

## 🚧 Current Development Status

This directory is actively being developed as part of the Quantum Forge 2.0 refactoring effort. Current focus areas:

- Implementation of responsive React components
- Integration with backend API services
- Development of scientific visualization tools
- Creation of intuitive user workflows
