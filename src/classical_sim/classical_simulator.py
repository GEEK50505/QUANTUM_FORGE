"""Stub: duplicate module moved to `backend.simulation`.

This file is a placeholder kept to preserve git history at the old path.
Canonical implementation is under `backend/simulation/classical_sim`.

Import from the canonical package instead, e.g.:

    from classical_sim.classical_simulator import ClassicalSimulator

Or use the backend path directly:

    from backend.simulation.classical_sim.classical_simulator import ClassicalSimulator

This file intentionally contains no implementation.
