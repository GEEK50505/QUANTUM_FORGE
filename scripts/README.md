# Development Scripts - Under Active Development

## 🛠️ Overview

This directory contains development, build, and maintenance scripts for the Quantum Forge platform.

**Status: Under Active Development** - This is a pre-beta development area. Scripts and tools are subject to change.

## 📁 Directory Structure

```bash
scripts/
├── build/         # Build and compilation scripts
├── test/          # Testing and validation scripts
├── deploy/        # Deployment automation scripts
├── dev/           # Development environment setup
├── maintenance/  # System maintenance and cleanup
├── migration/     # Data and schema migration tools
└── README.md     # This file
```

## 🎯 Purpose

The development scripts provide automation and tooling for:

- **Build Automation**: Compilation and packaging of components
- **Testing**: Automated testing and validation workflows
- **Deployment**: Release and deployment automation
- **Development**: Environment setup and developer tooling
- **Maintenance**: System cleanup and optimization tasks

## 🚧 Current Development Status

This directory is actively being developed as part of the Quantum Forge 2.0 refactoring effort. Current focus areas:

- Implementation of cross-platform build scripts
- Development of comprehensive testing frameworks
- Creation of deployment automation tools
- Integration with CI/CD pipelines

## 📚 Key Components (Planned)

### Build Scripts (`scripts/build/`)
- Source code compilation and optimization
- Package bundling and distribution
- Asset optimization and compression
- Version tagging and release preparation

### Test Automation (`scripts/test/`)
- Unit test execution and reporting
- Integration test orchestration
- Performance benchmarking
- Code quality and linting checks

### Deployment Tools (`scripts/deploy/`)
- Environment provisioning
- Service deployment and configuration
- Rollback and recovery procedures
- Health checks and monitoring

### Development Setup (`scripts/dev/`)
- Environment initialization
- Dependency installation
- IDE configuration
- Sample data generation

### Maintenance Utilities (`scripts/maintenance/`)
- Log cleanup and rotation
- Cache invalidation
- Database optimization
- Resource monitoring

### Migration Tools (`scripts/migration/`)
- Data format conversions
- Schema updates and versioning
- Backward compatibility tools
- Import/export utilities

## ⚠️ Important Notes

- **Pre-Beta Status**: All scripts are under active development
- **APIs Unstable**: Command-line interfaces may change
- **Documentation Incomplete**: Usage guides being actively created
- **Dependencies Evolving**: Tool requirements subject to change
