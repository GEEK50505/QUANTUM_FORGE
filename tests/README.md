# Tests (tests/) — UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT

Testing guidance and structure for unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

Recommended layout:
- `tests/unit/` — small, fast tests for individual modules
- `tests/integration/` — exercises API contracts and end-to-end flows
- `tests/e2e/` — optional UI or full-stack smoke tests

Run tests locally with `pytest` for Python and `npm test` for frontend when configured.

Status: UNDER ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT
