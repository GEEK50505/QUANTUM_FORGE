## 🧪 Hybrid Quantum-Classical Simulation Platform

Quantum Forge is a revolutionary platform for atom-accurate simulation of materials and electronic devices. It combines the speed of classical molecular dynamics with the accuracy of quantum mechanical calculations.

**⚠️ NOTE: This project is currently under active development. Features and APIs are subject to change.**

### 🔬 What is Hybrid Simulation?

Think of hybrid simulation like a "multi-scale microscope":
- **Classical part**: Shows the overall structure and motion (like a wide-angle lens)
- **Quantum part**: Shows detailed electronic properties (like a high-magnification lens)
- **Hybrid**: Switches between scales as needed for efficiency and accuracy

This approach gets the best of both worlds:
- **Speed**: Classical methods handle 90%+ of the work
- **Accuracy**: Quantum methods provide detailed information when needed
- **Scalability**: Can handle large systems with quantum accuracy in key regions
